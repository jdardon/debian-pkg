songwrite (0.14-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Fix breakage introduced in 0.14-5, 0.14-6 and 0.14-7 uploads:
    + Install Python modules into a private directory again.
    + Remove *.egg-info from the binary package; not really needed for
      anything.
    + Make the package ‘Architecture: all’ again.
    + Remove incorrect debian/pyversions.
    + Replace DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGE with actual package name, so that the
      the rule is actually invoked.
    + Drop 000_fix_modules_path.diff, no longer needed.
  * Build-depend on python (rather than on python-dev).
  * Remove debian/pycompat, it's not needed with current Python helpers.
    Build depend on cbds (>= 0.4.62~) and add XS-Python-Version to avoid
    recreating it at build time.
  * Bump standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes needed):
  * Drop debian/control.in, it was outdated anyway.
