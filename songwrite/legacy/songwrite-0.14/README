                           Songwrite

    A tablature editor with Python, Timidity and Lilypond.


Songwrite is a tablatures (guitar partitions) editor and player.
Songwrite is entirely written in Python.

Songwrite is the new name of GTablature. GTablature was similar to
Songwrite, but it was using different libraries (Gtk and Gnome instead
of Tk). The new version of Gtk (Gtk 2) was not compatible with the
previous one, and cannot be used along with Gtk 1 (in Python).
I really wonder what kind of hacker is ready to rewrite the whole
interface of his apps for each new version of the toolkit !
For these reasons, i've choosen to change the toolkit.

Songwrite can open the GTablature's files, and has a very similar look
and feel.

--- Installation ---
Untar the tarball.
Then you can immediately check Songwrite by running the ./songwrite
script.

Songwrite now uses Python's DistUtils for installation.
To install Songwrite, type (as root):

cd Songwrite-XXX
python ./setup.py install

NB: You'll get a warning at the end ("warning: install: modules
installed to '/usr/share/'..."); you can safely ignore this warning.

You can now run Songwrite by typing songwrite in a console.

By default, Songwrite is installed in /usr, you can modify the
setup.cfg file if you prefer another location.
