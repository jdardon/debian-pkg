                          EditObj 2

   A Java-Bean-like dialog box generator for Python objects,
   in Gtk 2 or Tk.


EditObj 2 is a dialog box generator for Python objects ; it can work
with both Gtk2 and Tk. It behaves similarly to a Java Bean editor, but
is devoted to Python, and it features several improvements. In
particular, EditObj2 can deal with tree structure in a very efficient
way.

Well... actually EditObj2 is much more that just a dialog box
generator. It is somehow a GUI toolkit per se... look at the examples
directory to see how to use it for designing a configuration dialog
box, a login window or a file manager !

EditObj 2 includes also a tree widget for Tkinter, an observation
framework and a mutiple undo/redo framework.

EditObj 2 is a complete rewrite of EditObj 1, and, despite both have
the same purpose, there is no compatibility between them.

EditObj 2 is entirely written in Python. EditObj is Free Software,
under the GNU GPL. It has been tested with Python 2.5, although older
version may work (or not).
