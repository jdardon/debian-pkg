Description: EditObj 2 is a dialog box generator for Python objects, using Gtk 2, Tk, Qt or Qtopia (at your choice). It behaves similarly to a Java Bean editor, but is devoted to Python, and it features several improvements. In particular, it can deal with tree structure of objects in a very efficient way.
        Well... actually EditObj2 is more that just a dialog box generator. It is somehow a GUI per se... look at the examples directory to see its power :-)
        EditObj2 is entirely written in Python.
Platform: UNKNOWN
